# WebBook Implementation

Implement a version of WebBook which could combine WebBook Level 1 (Unofficial Proposal Draft by Daniel Glazman:) See http://glazman.org/e0/webbook.html combined with combine W3C Publication Manifest (W3C 2020) https://www.w3.org/TR/pub-manifest/

## Motivation:

- to replace website generation on GitHub Page and replacing Hugo/Jekyll frameworks with XHTML
- to have a functioning manifest of the publication as it appears W3C have dropped further development
- to prepare to bring more complex digital 'Open Science' objects and 'literate programming' into book production 

## Work done so far

 - Vivliostyle have indentified WebBook Level 1 (Unofficial Proposal Draft by Daniel Glazman:) and W3C Publication Manifest (W3C 2020) as being the frameworks to combine
 - Vivliostyle and Fidus confirm that the modifications could be made to EPUB withough breaking EPUB validation
 - Fidus have made uncompressed EPUB output format to GitHub export
 - Fidus have added <nav> tag to ToC
 - vivlio confirm multi-document uncpressed EPUB will render in Vivlio 

## Roadmap  

 - @mrchristian (SW) to write up spec for Hugo/Jekyll replacement to build websites on Github Pages using uncompressed EPUB
 - Get partners together to realise a version 1 of WebBook
